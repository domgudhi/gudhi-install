# gudhi-install

## Motivation

Current github repository is kind of tutorial for building and using GUDHI a software library for Topological Data Analysis.

GUDHI can be built in various ways, but this repo is for building it using binder (a challenge ;-)

If a binder building is successful it will be easy to share it among users for GUDHI demonstrations.

## Building

Building time can be about thirty minutes.

A dedicated server is comfy for a complete install of a binderhub.

## Limitations

Free binder websites are limited in docker images size, hence the challenge.

## Licences

GUDHI and binder and Jupyterhub licences apply : no commercial use.

This repo can be cloned for further branch updates, no acknowledgments are asked ;-)
