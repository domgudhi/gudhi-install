# gudhi-install

## Motivation

Current github repository is kind of tutorial for building and using GUDHI a software library for Topological Data Analysis.

GUDHI can be built in various ways, but this repo is for building it using binder (a challenge ;-)

If a binder building is successful it will be easy to share it among users for GUDHI demonstrations.

## Limitations

Free binder websites are limited in docker images size, hence the challenge.
